# Word Ladders
# -------------------

# Given two words (begin_word and end_word), and a dictionary's word list, return the shortest transformation sequence
# from begin_word to end_word, such that:

# Only one letter can be changed at a time.

# Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that begin_word is not a transformed word.

# Note:


# Return None if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
# You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
# You may assume begin_word and end_word are non-empty and are not the same.


# start: hit
# ending: cog

# hit -> hot -> hog -> cog
# hit -> hot -> cot -> cog
