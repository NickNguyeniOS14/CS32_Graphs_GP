# Graphs

## Day 1

- What is a graph?

# cylic graph -- a graph that has a cycle in it
# Acylic graph -- not a cyclic graph-- has no cycles

Bonus: Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* ("A star")

Graph Representations 
---------------------

* Adjacency Matrix

    A   B   C
A   f   T   T

B   T   T   T

B   f   f   f

* Adjacency List (We'll use this)


# Linked list and tree are graphs

edges = {
'A' : [B,C],
'B' : [B,A,C], # order doesn't matter 
'C' : []

}
